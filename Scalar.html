  <h3>An Anki2 add-on</h3>
  

      </header>
      
<article id="scalar" class="clear">
  <div class="articleBody">

    <figure>
      <img src="/anki-addons/images/scalar.png" alt="Two lines of Text: 1: Frankreich hat 65 Millionen Einwohner. 2: 70 → 65. The 70 is blue, the 65 green." />
     <figcaption>70 is close to 65.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    
    <p>When learning some types of numbers, like the number of inhabitants of
a country, getting it almost right is good enough. This add-on colors
the answer in yellow when it was close to the original answer.</p>
<p>The answer is also re-arranged into a single line, and typically shown
with the standard font, not a monospace one.</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<figure>
<img src="images/compare_by_char.png" alt="Similar to the image
above. The 70 and 65 are in two lines. The 70 is gray on red, the 65
gray on gray.">
<figcaption>
Without this add-on: even though the typed in answer is close to the
correct one, it is marked in red.
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In the image, the correct answer is “65”, when you know it is close to
70, you type that. The original behavior is to compare character by
character, and mark the typed answer red: a 7 is no 6 and a 0 is no
5. With this add-on, the whole answer would be yellow, as it is close
to the correct answer.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you had typed “650” as the answer, with the
original behavior, you would get the “65” marked green and “0” marked
red, showing more green, even though the answer is farther from the
correct one.  With this add-on the 650 would be completely red.</p>
<h2>Setup</h2>
<h3>Fields</h3>
<p>To use, the name of the answer field (the <code>{{type:NN}}</code> bit) must
contain the word “Scalar”. (E.g. “Area_Scalar” or “Inhabitants_Scalar”
for a geography deck or “Atomic_Mass_Scalar” for a chemistry deck.)</p>
<p>For fields without
“Scalar” in the name the behavior stays the same, doing the
character-by-character comparison.</p>
<h3>CSS</h3>
<p>Like Anki itself, this add-on is doing the coloring with CSS
classes. It reuses two of the standard classes, <code>typeGood</code> and
<code>typeBad</code>, and uses the class <code>typePass</code> for the yellow close-enough
bits. To modify the display, styling for these classes should be added
to the card styling. The <code>div</code> containing the numbers also has the
class <code>typedscalar</code>, so that these numbers can be styled differently
from typed-in text.</p>
<p>The example images where taken with a somewhat complex note
type, using this type of CSS setup. In this case:
<blockquote class=lsting><pre><code><span>.card {color: #657b83; background-color: #fdf6e3;}
#typeans span {background-color: #fdf6e3;}
.typeBad {color: #dc322f;}
.typeMissed, .typePass {  color: #268bd2;}
.typeGood{color: #859900;} </code></pre></blockquote></p>
<p>This also changes the “pass”/“close enough” color from the yellow
mentioned in the text to blue.</p>
<p>The basic color scheme is called
<a href="http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized">Solarized</a>.</p>
<h3>Close enough factor</h3>
<p>To change what counts as “close enough” change the <code>pass_factor</code> in
the .py source file.</p>
<h2>Anki version</h2>
<p>Please make sure that you are running a version of Anki ≥ 2.0.9, as
the comparison mechanism was changed for that release.</p>
