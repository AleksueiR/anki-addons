                <p>When learning some types of numbers, like the number of inhabitants of
a country, often close is good enough. This add-on makes Anki show
that, it colors the answer in yellow when it was close to the
original answer.</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>In the image correct answer is “48”, when you know it’s close to 50,
you type that. The original behavior was to compare character by character,
and show the typed answer in red, a 5 is no 4 and a 0 is no 8. With this add-on, the whole answer
would be yellow, as it is  close to the correct answer.</p>
<p>On the
other hand, if you had typed  “400” as the answer, with the original
behavior, you would get the “4” in green and “00” in red, showing more
green, even though the answer is farther from the correct one than the
“50”.</p>
<p>With this add-on the 400 would be completely red.</p>
<h2>Setup</h2>
<h3>Inside Anki</h3>
<p>To use, the name of the answer field (the <code>{{type:NN}}</code> bit) must
contain the word “Scalar”. (E.g. “Area_Scalar” or “Inhabitants_Scalar”
for a geography deck or “Atomic_Mass_Scalar” for a chemistry deck.)</p>
<p>For fields without
“Scalar” in the name the behavior stays the same, doing the
character-by-character comparison.</p>
<h3>Configuration</h3>
<p>To change the factor what counts as “close enough” change the
<code>pass_factor</code> in the .py source file. There are also a few other
things that can somewhat easily be changed. The comments in thy source
file should be a help.</p>
<h2>“Correct answer was:”</h2>
<figure>
<img src="images/compare_by_char.png" alt="Anki review window with
text: Niedersachsen ist 48 tausend km² groß. 50. Correct answer was:
48. The 50 is marked in red.">
<figcaption>Even though the typed in answer is close to the correct
one, there is a lot of red and extra text.</figcaption></figure>

<p>When this add-on is working, the “Correct answer
was:” text is not shown at all. This is partly due to the way the
add-on operates, but i see this as a bonus, not a problem. At this
time, people who really want this text could possibly add it to their
own copy of the add-on. (In other words,
