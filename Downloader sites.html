                <p>These sites are tried to retrieve audio clips:</p>
<h2>Beolingus</h2>
<p><a href="http://dict.tu-chemnitz.de/doc/about.en.html">Beolingus</a> is an online
dictionary provided by the
<a href="http://www.tu-chemnitz.de/en/"><span class="qtbase tu" lang="de">TU</span> Chemnitz</a>.</p>
<p>The site provides German↔English, German↔Portuguese and German↔Spanish
dictionaries and pronunciations in English, German and Spanish. Some
of the English pronunciations appear to be wrong, so the non-German
words are deleted by default. (The delete button is preselected and the
user has to click the add button to keep the file).</p>
<h2>Collins</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.collinsdictionary.com/">Collins Dictoonaries</a> are used for
French, German, Italian and Spanish. Here, too, the quality of the
pronunciations didn’t really convince me, so the files will be deleted
by default, too.</p>
<h2>Duden</h2>
<p>The <a href="http://www.duden.de">Duden</a> is pretty much the reference
dictionary for Germany. Many of the audio files are from the
<a href="http://www.ard.de/intern/abc/-/id=1643802/nid=1643802/did=1666544/2b9hfd/index.html#abcListItem_1666544">Aussprachedatenbank der ARD</a>.
It looks like these are used as the reference by the German <a href="http://www.tagesschau.de">newscast
of record</a>.</p>
<h2><span id='gtts'>Google TTS</span></h2>
<p>Goole TTS is the text-to-speech part of
<a href="http://translate.google.com/#auto/en/">Google Translate</a>.  It is the
only text-to-speech services among the downloaders. The advantage is
that this will almost always get you an audio version of the text
entered – when Google TTS works for your language at all – and can be
used to get an audio version of whole sentences, not just single
words.</p>
<p>The disadvantage is that that this will almost always get you an audio
version of the text entered, even when it is misspelled.</p>
<p>Another disadvantage is that it is a robot voice. It may hide
idiosyncrasies of the phrase or word. Because of this, Google TTS
files are deleted by default, too.</p>
<p>For Chinese, the Google TTS download is skipped by default, because
the <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/3448800906">Chinese support</a>
add-on downloads those, too. When you don’t use that add-on or want to
download from Google TTS with this add-on anyway, you can switch it
back on by changing the <code>False</code> in the <code>get_chinese</code> line near the
head of the
<a href="https://github.com/ospalh/anki-addons/blob/master/downloadaudio/downloaders/google_tts.py"><code>googl_tts.py</code></a>
file to <code>True</code>.</p>
<h2>Howjsay</h2>
<p>Requests for English words are sent to <a href="http://howjsay.com/">howjsay.com</a>.</p>
<h2><span id="jpod">JapanesePod</span></h2>
<p>Downloads audio provided by
<a href="http://www.japanesepod101.com/">JapanesePod101</a>.  This is the same
data source as
<a href="http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~jwb/cgi-bin/wwwjdic.cgi?1C">Jim Breen's WWWJDIC</a>
uses for its Japanese audio. WWWJDIC
is the dictionary called <q>edict</q> by the
<a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/3918629684">Japanese Support add-on</a>.</p>
<p>The JapanesePod101 collection has several files for words that are
usually written with kana alone, like <q lang="ja">ください</q>, but
written with kanji, <q lang="ja">下さい</q>. In cases like these the
add-on asks the WWWJDIC site for the kanji version of the word, based
on the reading.</p>
<p>This site was the main motivation for writing this add-on. By
providing a way to download these pronunciations this add-on is a
replacement for the Anki 1 plugins <q>Audio Download</q> and <q>Audio
Download (Extension)</q>.</p>
<h3><span id="blacklist">Blacklist</span></h3>
<p>The download mechanism at JapanesePod can’t really say
<a href="nopagehere.html"><q>no</q></a> in the usual way. Instead it sends you an
audio clip that tells you <q>The audio for this clip is currently not
available. It will be recorded and uploaded shortly. Thank you for
your patience.</q>. While that is a nice gesture, after hearing that
message two or three times the voice starts sounding a bit like <span
class="qtbase sonya">Sonya</span>.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/blacklist.png"
alt="Review dialog with a skull-and-bones button">
<figcaption>Use the skull-and-bones button to blacklist a file.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>To deal with this phenomenon, this add-on provides another button in
the download review dialog, called <q>blacklist</q>. Click this for
each file where you get the <q>… currently not available…</q>
spiel. The add-on will then store a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function">hash</a> for
this file. When the same file is seen again, it is quietly dropped and
you may receive a <q>Nothing downloaded</q> message.</p>
<h2>Leo</h2>
<p>These audio files come from
<a href="http://www.leo.org/index_en.html">LEO GmbH</a>, originaly founded by the
<a href="http://www.in.tum.de/en.html">Department of Informatics</a> of the
<a href="http://www.tum.de/en/homepage/"><span class="qtbase tu">TU</span> München</a>.
They offer several German↔NN dictionaries, with audio files for
English, French, German and Spanish. I could not find spoken words for
other languages, but they may be added in the future, when they
appear.</p>
<h2>Lexin</h2>
<p>Swedish pronunciation from the
<a href="http://lexin.nada.kth.se/lexin/">lexikon för invandrare</a> of the
<a href="http://www.sprakochfolkminnen.se/">Institutet för språk och folkminnen</a>
and the <a href="https://www.kth.se/">Kungliga Tekniska högskolan</a>.</p>
<h2>Macmillan</h2>
<p>This downloader gets  pronunciations from the
<a href="http://www.macmillandictionary.com/">Macmillan Dictionary</a> site.</p>
<p>Apart from the pronunciation, for some words that name sounds or
noises, the dictionary offers sound effects, that are also
downloaded. Try downloading
<q><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_music">house</a></q> or
<q>thunder</q>. The sound effects should be marked in the bubble help
text in the review.</p>
<p>Macmillan Dictionary is available in a British English and an American
English version. To counterbalance the American English of
oher downloaders, the standard install of the add-on uses the British
version. See <a href="#sitesonoff">below</a> how to turn on the American English
version instead.</p>
<h2>Merriam-Webster</h2>
<p>American English pronunciations from the
<a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/info/index.htm">Merriam-Webster</a>
online dictionary.</p>
<h2>Oxford Advanced American Dictionary</h2>
<p>American English pronunciations from
<a href="http://oaadonline.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/">Oxford Advanced American Dictionary</a>.</p>
<h2>Wiktionary</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.wiktionary.org">Wiktionary</a> is the dictionary branch of Wikipedia.</p>
<p>The add-on tries to download words for every language. Where you get
any results is hard to say.</p>
<p>As these sound files are all uploaded by users, it is possible (even
if unlikely) that some files do not contain what the should. They
<em>might</em> even contain obscenities. The
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Content_disclaimer">content disclaimer</a>
from Wikipedia applies. If you encounter an incorrect file, the best
way to proceed is to clean up the Wiktionary page in
question.</p>
<p>The different language versions of Wiktionary add audio clips in
different ways to their word pages. When the add-on did not download a
pronunciation that is present on a specific Wiktionary page, please
<a href="https://github.com/ospalh/anki-addons/issues?state=open">report this</a>. I
will then try to find a way to extract that word, so that it should be
downloaded with an updated version of the add-on.</p>
<h2><span id="not_forvo"><em>Not</em> Forvo</span></h2>
<p>A number of people have asked for the crowd-sourced pronunciation site
<a href="http://forvo.com">Forvo</a> to be added. While the pronunciations
offered are usually quite useful (even if sometimes of a low audio
quality), adding the site to this add-on does <em>not</em> work. Downloading
from Forvo requires what is called <span class="qtbase
onlyone">an</span> <q>API-key</q>. This key would have to be both kept
secret and included in the published add-on source. A contardiction.</p>
<p>(The way Forvo apparently intends this kind of key to be used is to
add a service to a web site, rather than to a bit of free, published
software. The web service owner would than keep eir hands on the key
and hand out just the pronunciations. This add-on does not work this
way.)</p>
<p>My <q lang="de"><a href="Nachschlagen.html">Nachschlagen</a></q> add-on adds a
menu item too look up, but not download, words at Forvo.</p>
<h2><span id="sitesonoff">Using different sites</span></h2>
<p>The add-on loads the different downloaders through the list
<q><code>downloaders</code></q> in the file “<a
href="https://github.com/ospalh/anki-addons/blob/master/downloadaudio/downloaders/__init__.py">
<code>downloadaudio/downloaders/__init__.py</code></a>”. To get to the file, use
the <q>Tools/Add-ons/Open Add-ons Folder...</q>  menu item, then open the
folder <q><code>downloadaudio</code></q> and in there <q><code>downloaders</code></q>.</p>
<p>The downloaders are tried in the order they appear there. To change
this order or to switch on or off downloaders, rearrange the list
entries, or add or remove <q><code>#</code></q> characters before the name. Lines
starting with a <q><code>#</code></q> are comments in Python. Those lines are not
used, nothing will be downloaded from these sites.</p>
<p>For example, to change the Macmillan downloads from British English to
American English, add a <q><code>#</code></q> character to the line
<q><code>MacmillanBritishDownloader(),</code></q> and remove it from the line
<q><code># MacmillanAmericanDownloader(),</code></q>. (Do not remove the comma or
parentheses. Do not make other changes unless you know what you are
doing.)</p>
<p>After you have made changes to the file and saved it, you need to
restart Anki for the changes to take effect.</p>
